Extract test cases from TFS and write them in XML for TestRail to import.
 
## Changes
Extract the Steps with the Description as well from the TFS. The Description is mapped with the Precondition TextField in the TestRail.

If you want to change the PreCondition field instead of the Description for every Test case you can just change in the Code.

## Refer
This code is inspired from the following Project available already in the GitHub:
https://github.com/kingchad1989/TFS2TestRailXML/releases

Updated the Project with the Latest .Net Framework and updated the Nuget packages to connect the TFS server with the changes about Description and Steps.
